## 2. DL applied to TS resources: third party resources
This is the section where we can share useful thrid party resources. 

### Datasets: 
- [UEA & UCR Time Series Classification](http://www.timeseriesclassification.com): contains 128 univariate and 30 multivariate datasets.
- [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php): contains 452 ML datasets, with 86 [time series](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html?format=&task=&att=&area=&numAtt=&numIns=&type=ts&sort=attUp&view=table) (most multivariate datasets, both classifications and regression).

### Libraries/ packages:
- **Algorithms:**
    - [pyts](https://johannfaouzi.github.io/pyts/index.html): is a Python package for time series transformation and classification. It aims to provide state-of-the-art as well as recently published algorithms for time series classification.
    - [tslearn](https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): is a Python package that provides machine learning tools for the analysis of time series. This package builds on (and hence depends on) scikit-learn, numpy and scipy libraries.
    - [PyDLM](https://github.com/wwrechard/pydlm): A python library for Bayesian time series modeling.


- **Databases:**
    - [arctic](https://github.com/manahl/arctic): high performance datastore for time series and tick data.
    - [PyStore](https://github.com/ranaroussi/pystore): fast data store for Pandas timeseries data. 
    - [Gnocchi](https://github.com/gnocchixyz/gnocchi): Gnocchi is an open-source time series database.
